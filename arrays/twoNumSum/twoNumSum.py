##Two Number Sum

##Take in non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum.

##If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return an array (any order).

##If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array.

##Note that the target sum has to be obtained by summing two different integers in the array.

##You can't add a single integer to itself in order to obtain the target sum.

##You can assume that there will be at most one pair of numbers summing up to the target sum.
